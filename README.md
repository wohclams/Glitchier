## Glitchier

A (Chrome only, for now) browser extension that adds extra functionality and options for [glitch.com](https://glitch.com), including collapsable folders in the file list.

Still work-in-progress and not yet submitted to the Chrome Store. Feel free to download and "Load unpacked" to install locally.

### Current Features
* Adds nested, collapsable folders to the Glitch file list.

### Todo
* Persist folder state
* Configurable spaces vs tabs options for Glitch editor
* Option to show/hide the full file path for files within folders.
